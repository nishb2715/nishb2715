## ML Easter Eggs

**Click to reveal some wild AI truths!** 👇

<details>
<summary>🤯 The "73 cents" bug that almost killed a company</summary>

In 2012, Knight Capital's trading algorithm had a bug that caused it to buy high and sell low repeatedly. **In 45 minutes**, it lost **$440 million**. The company's stock dropped 73 cents... oh wait, I mean 73%. One. Buggy. Loop. 💸

**Lesson:** Always test your models in production-like environments!
</details>


<details>
<summary>🎨 GANs were invented because of an argument at a bar</summary>

Ian Goodfellow invented GANs in 2014 after a heated debate with friends at a bar about generative models. He went home, coded it up the same night, and it worked on the first try. **Beer-driven innovation** at its finest! 🍺🤖

**Fun fact:** He didn't even debug it. First run = success. We're all jealous.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🧠 GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters...</summary>

To put that in perspective:
- If each parameter were a grain of sand, you'd fill **3.5 Olympic swimming pools**
- If you counted one parameter per second, it would take **5,500+ years**
- The model file is **350GB+** (good luck fitting that on your laptop!)

And GPT-4? Even bigger. Nobody knows exactly how big (OpenAI keeps secrets 🤫)
</details>



<details>
<summary>🔮 Neural networks are older than you think</summary>

The **perceptron** was invented in **1958**! That's 66+ years ago! We've been trying to make computers think like brains since before the internet existed. 

**Plot twist:** The first neural network was implemented in **hardware**, not software. Imagine debugging that with no Stack Overflow! 😅
</details>

<details>
<summary>⚡ Why training models takes forever</summary>

A single **matrix multiplication** in a transformer might involve multiplying two **12,000 × 12,000** matrices. That's **1.7 BILLION** individual operations. 

And you do this **thousands of times** per batch. Per epoch. For **hundreds of epochs**. 

**Total operations?** Quintillions. Yes, that's a real number. 🤯

**No wonder** your GPU sounds like a jet engine!
